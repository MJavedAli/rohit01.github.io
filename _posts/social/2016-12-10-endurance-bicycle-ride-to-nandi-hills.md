Last Sunday, my alarm rang with a musical note, I turned it off and saw it's 4:15 in the morning. Excited, I woke up at the very first sound or it. It was my first test of endurance on a bicycle. I quickly got ready, packed my bag and opened google map to confirm the route I will be following. And the journey started - 5:30 AM.

It was still dark, shops closed and the roads belonged to just one being - *dogs*. Safety was the number one thought in my mind. However, after a while, I started thinking, *"when was the last time I rode a bicycle?"*. It happened to be close to 5 years and the effect was clearly visible. I found myself searching for motorcycle controls sub-consciously. I accidently pressed gear button twice thinking or horn and indicator lights. When a gas station came, I almost entered thinking of refueling the tank. At every traffic signal, flyover I was thinking, how easy it looked to zoom past these on a bike. Then, I appreciated the moment as this realization would have never been there if I always went to Nandi hills on a motorcycle.

At around 6:30 AM, I reached Hebbal flyover. I took a short break, drank some aloe-vera juice which I prepared at home (a big mistake). Feeling refreshed, I started again and went over the awesome expressway. Soon, the aloe-veera juice did its job. I started looking for toilets on top of the flyover. I realized, the stretch of flyover was many kilometers long before it actually touches the ground. With no option in sight, I continued riding. I was thinking, it's not easy for an amatuer like me. I should probably, back off. Finally, the flyover ended at Yelahanka and I started looking for options. A security guard was kind enough to guide me to a nearby Sulabh International.

At 7:40 AM, I was a little tired. I took a tea break and continued my journey. To distract myself from the pain, I started looking at the scenery. It was refreshing. I reached halfway at around 8:30 AM. This boasted my confidence and now I was determined to complete the mission. I pushed myself over numerous mighty flyovers. At last, the highway ended, I was excited to ride on the lush green Nandi Hills road. At around 10:30 AM, destination was another 11 km away. Feeling very tired, I took another break. This time, it took me a while to re-assure myself that I can do it. I gently crossed the traffic checkpost, 7 km uphill track remained. At 11:50 AM, 5 km remained. I took 15-20 mins for the next 1 km and saw a roadside stall. Tired and hungry, I had some light breakfast and met few more riders - Prateek & Abhijit.

After refueling and engerzing myself, I continued the journey. The roads were steep, sometimes scary due to loose gravels as well. Finally, I made it at 1:12 PM. It was really satisfying to see the gates of nandi hills. Mission accomplished :D

I had some chat with the my new cyclist friends. We had a brief photo session and then decided to head back together. Riding downhill was amazing and supereasy. We overtook bikes, cars showed us down as the road was not wide enough to overtake them. Riding back was easier than it seemed. Bangalore is at a lower elevation compared to Nandi village. At the same time, to keep up with them, I stretched a lot. At one point, just before the airport flyover, I was completely exhausted. We took a small break and continued till a food outlet - McDonalds. They planned to go on a different way, so, I bid goodbye to them. It was 4 PM.

Completely exhausted, I decided to take a 30-40 mins break. My full lower body was paining like hell. I had the first real meal of the day and made a few phone calls. It was relaxing. I decided to start again at 4:40 PM, around 35 km to go. Slowly and steadily, I continued my journey and reached home at 7 PM.

Looking back, I realize, I made the following avoidable miskes:

* Carried too much luggage - 2.5 liter water, eatables, camera, headphones, first aid, etc. I ended up emptying my bottles on the road to reduce weight. Its advisable to carry as little as possible. Most cyclist just carry a bottle of water/electrolyte drink along with few eatables like biscuits.
* Aloe-vera juice is not an alternative to an electrolyte drink. Coconut water is best.
* Mountain bike (MTB) is not suitable for highway tours. Its slow and required much more effort.

Finally, thanks [@krishnaghatti](https://twitter.com/krishnaghatti) for lending your bicycle to me. You are awesome. **And as always, Thanks for reading :-)**
